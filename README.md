# VR Project 2 Readme #

Raspartment is a virtual apartment. By pushing the button on the cardboard headset you can be transported around the apartment. For each push of the button the Jupiter globe will either start spinning or stop spinning.

I had a lot of fun working on this project. I spent way more time on it than I needed to. I played around with animations and also looking at items to import from the asset store. I found some decent free ones to spice up the apartment. I had a video file I used as a texture and made it so the TV screen had a video playing but that feature was not supported on smartphones so I took it out.

I also included pictures on the walls which were pictures I took of areas on the East Coast. I also created a skybox using a photosphere I took which is the area around my actual apartment. It's kind of neat to look through the virtual windows and see what is actually outside my real apartment.

I probably put 20 hours into this but had already completed the bulk of the project in around 6 hours. I had a lot of trouble with the lighting. Everything was looking great but once I followed the steps outlined in the rubric it made everything washed out. So I see where I need to play around more and what to practice on.

The project was submitted and there were errors running it from the reviewer. I think somewhere along the line I messed it up and possibly deleted something or moved something in a weird spot. So, I saved every section of the apartment as a prefab, exported it to a package and imported them into a new starter project. It ended up working and I saved my work!

I had fun working on this part of the course and learned a lot.
